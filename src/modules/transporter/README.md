# Transporter Module

## Overview

The Transporter module is a comprehensive biogas delivery management system that implements the SAUB-FE-002 story specifications. It provides end-to-end functionality for managing biogas deliveries, from scheduling to confirmation.

## Features

### 7 Core Screens

1. **Dashboard** - Real-time overview of delivery operations
2. **Schedule Manager** - Manage delivery schedules and appointments
3. **Route Optimization** - Optimize delivery routes for efficiency
4. **Active Deliveries** - Track live deliveries and locations
5. **Delivery Confirmation** - Confirm completed deliveries with signatures/photos
6. **Vehicle Management** - Manage fleet vehicles and maintenance
7. **Delivery History** - View completed deliveries and performance metrics

## Key Technologies & Patterns

### Architecture Patterns
- **BaseLayout Pattern** - Follows the existing admin module pattern
- **Lazy Loading** - All pages are lazy-loaded for performance
- **Container Pattern** - Main container handles routing and navigation
- **Service Layer** - Clean separation between UI and data logic

### TypeScript Implementation
- **Comprehensive Types** - Full type coverage for all data structures
- **Interface Segregation** - Separate interfaces for different concerns
- **Type Safety** - Strict typing throughout the module

### UI/UX Design
- **shadcn/ui Components** - Consistent with the existing design system
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Loading States** - Proper loading indicators and error handling
- **Real-time Updates** - Live data updates for active deliveries

## Data Model

### Core Entities

#### Vehicle
- Registration, type (truck/van/tanker), capacity
- Current location, fuel level, maintenance schedule
- Driver assignment and operating hours

#### Driver
- Personal details, license information
- Status (available/on_delivery/off_duty)
- Performance metrics and ratings

#### DeliverySchedule
- Customer information and delivery details
- Time slots, priority levels, special instructions
- Cost calculations and duration estimates

#### Route
- Start/end locations with waypoints
- Distance, duration, and cost optimization
- Vehicle and driver assignments

#### Delivery
- Real-time tracking and status updates
- Customer confirmation with signatures/photos
- Performance metrics and feedback

## Mock Data Service

The module includes a comprehensive mock data service (`mockDataService.ts`) that provides:

- **Realistic Sample Data** - Production-like data for all entities
- **API Simulation** - Simulates network delays and responses
- **CRUD Operations** - Full create, read, update, delete functionality
- **Error Handling** - Simulates various error scenarios
- **Performance Metrics** - Calculates delivery performance indicators

## Navigation & Routing

The module uses a clean navigation structure:

```
/transporter/dashboard      - Main dashboard
/transporter/schedule       - Schedule management
/transporter/routes         - Route optimization
/transporter/deliveries     - Active deliveries
/transporter/confirmation   - Delivery confirmation
/transporter/vehicles       - Vehicle management
/transporter/history        - Delivery history
```

## Features Implementation

### Dashboard
- Real-time metrics and KPIs
- System alerts and notifications
- Quick action buttons
- Performance overview charts

### Schedule Manager
- Searchable schedule list with filters
- Priority-based scheduling
- Customer information management
- Time slot optimization

### Route Optimization
- AI-powered route optimization
- Multiple optimization criteria (time, distance, cost)
- Real-time traffic considerations
- Savings calculations and reporting

### Active Deliveries
- Live tracking with GPS coordinates
- Real-time status updates
- Driver communication tools
- Delivery timeline visualization

### Delivery Confirmation
- Digital signature capture
- Photo documentation
- Customer satisfaction ratings
- Issue reporting and resolution

### Vehicle Management
- Fleet overview and status monitoring
- Maintenance scheduling and tracking
- Fuel level monitoring
- Driver assignments

### Delivery History
- Comprehensive delivery records
- Performance analytics
- Export capabilities
- Customer feedback integration

## Integration Points

### BaseLayout Integration
- Uses the existing BaseLayout component
- Consistent navigation and styling
- User authentication and role management

### shadcn/ui Components
- Card, Button, Badge components
- Form inputs and validation
- Loading and error states
- Responsive grid layouts

## Error Handling

- **Loading States** - Skeleton loading for all pages
- **Error Boundaries** - Graceful error handling and recovery
- **Network Errors** - Retry mechanisms and user feedback
- **Validation** - Form validation and user input sanitization

## Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading** - Code splitting for all major components
- **Efficient Rendering** - Optimized re-renders and state management
- **Data Caching** - Smart caching of frequently accessed data
- **Image Optimization** - Optimized image loading and display

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Real-time GPS tracking integration
- Push notifications for status updates
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with external mapping services
- Mobile app companion features

### Scalability Considerations
- Database integration ready
- API service layer prepared

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```typescript
import { TransporterModule } from '@/modules/transporter';

// Use in main app routing
<Route path="/transporter/*" element={<TransporterModule />} />
```

### Individual Component Usage
```typescript
import {
  TransporterDashboard,
  TransporterScheduleManager
} from '@/modules/transporter';

// Use individual components
<TransporterDashboard />
<TransporterScheduleManager />
```

### Type Usage
```typescript
import { Vehicle, Delivery, DeliverySchedule } from '@/modules/transporter';

const vehicle: Vehicle = {
  id: 'v001',
  registrationNumber: 'MH12AB1234',
  type: 'tanker',
  capacity: 2000,
  status: 'active'
  // ... other properties
};
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow existing TypeScript patterns
- Use proper error handling
- Implement loading states
- Maintain responsive design
- Add proper accessibility features

### Testing Considerations
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for data flows
